String can be defined in 2 ways by writting String a or by creat9ing string class
Can  writre any methods insidde the Puboic static void main
Java lang package has all String ,Integer etc Java util has Date,calendar,List,Arrays, all collections etc
Cant use Private class or var inside an Interface becuase interface forces to define its methods in other classes which implements it.
// variables defijed in interface should always be public
inside interface var can be  static or non static no problem
One calss can implement multiple interfaces
A class can implement 2 interfaces having the same method name , no error will be shown

COLLECTIONS
List set and Maps are all interfaces ehich has many classes 
List - ArrayList,LikndedList,velocity   Set - Hashset,TreeSet,LinkedHashset
List accesspts duplicate values and values are in sequence
Set doesnot acept duplicate vals nd values r not in sequence
Difference between HashMap and HashTable 
HashMap is non synchronised and not thread safe , means only one programme at atime  can access a hashTable
HashMap used Iterator to iterate thru whereas hashTbale and also Vector uses Enumerator to iterate thru
MashMap allowes one Null key and multiple Null values whereas HashTable doesnt allow any Null keys or values
